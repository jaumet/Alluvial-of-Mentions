# Alluvial-of-Mentions
A minimalist SVG gallery using panzoom.js and jquery

USAGE:
Just put the code as it is under a web server.

DEMO:
At the moment there is a beta version here: http://research.nualart.cat/peace/alluvial/

DATA
This distribution contain several SVG diagrams about Peace Agreements database (http://peacegreements.org). You can add your own SVG or any other image or video format. 

You'll need some knowledge of HTML-CSS-JS in order to hack it for your use. The code I did is really short and it works quite smoothely. I hope you enjoy it!

Credits: this tiny app uses jquery.js jquery-ui.js and panzoom.js. The first verson of the SVG alluvial was made with RAWgraphs. Thanks to all of them!
